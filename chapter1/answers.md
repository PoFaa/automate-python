	* -88.8 value

	* - operator

	* / operator

	* + operator

Name three data types?
	
	*Integers, floats and strings

An expression is made up of values and operators

An expression can evaluate..reduce down to a single value

What is the difference between an expression and a statement

The variable name spam in the expression spam = 10 has the interger value 10 assigned to it.

bacon = 20 doesnt reassign to bacon 21 you need bacon = bacon +1

What should these two expressions evaluate to:

'spam' + 'spamspam' & 'spam'*3 both evaluate to spamspamspam

Why is eggs a valid variable name and 100 is not? Variables cannot begin with a number

What three functions can be used to get the interger, floating-point, number, or string version of a value?

	* int(), floating-point(), number() string()
	* 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + 'burritos.'
